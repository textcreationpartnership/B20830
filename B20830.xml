            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Upon the 23 of <hi>Ianuary</hi> aforeſaid being Monday, Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> Generall of the Forces, marched from Bradford ſixe
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:197026:3"/>myles diſtant from thence, with ſixe Troops of Horſe, and three of Dragoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, under the command of Sir <hi>Henry Fowles</hi> Baronet, Commiſſary generall of the Horſe, and 600 Muſqueteers with 1200 Club-men under the command of Sir <hi>William Fairfax</hi> Colonel, and then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of the Foot: with theſe we mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched from Bradford aforeſayd, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached neere the Town, about one of the clocke, at which time ſir <hi>Thomas</hi> ſent a Trumpeter unto ſir <hi>William Savill,</hi> who commanded in chief there under the Earl of New caſtle, His Majeſties Generall for the Northern parts, requiring the Town to be delivered unto him for the King and Parliament, but his anſwer was as wiſe as himſelfe; for he ſayd, That he won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred that ſir <hi>Thomas</hi> was ſo uncivill as to come ſo neere the Towne before he had made him acquainted with it, and that there might be more vertue in his Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, than in that paper he ſent before he came there.</p>
            <p>Whereupon, Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> ſet his battell
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:197026:3"/>in order, gave out the word of Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance, which was <hi>Emanuel,</hi> and to the Commander of the Foot, with his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſary generall, their ſtations charges and commands riding from place to place, and encouraging his men to fall on reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, which being encouraged by the valour of their Leaders, they did accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly: and al hough moſt of them were but unexperienced freſh-water Souldiers taken up about Bradford and Hallifax but upon the Saturday before, yet they came on reſolutely and valiantly, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the Muſquetiers under the command of Sir <hi>William Fairfax,</hi> Commander of the Foot, who valiantly in the head of his Regiment, and the face of his enemies, ſtormed the Towne, whereupon began very hot ſervice, the Souldiers playing very ſharply from their Trenches and Workes upon our men without; but they were anſwered with ſuch courage and reſolution, that notwithſtanding their uttermoſt endeavours, and the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of their Drakes which were often
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:197026:4"/>diſcharged upon us, we killed their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonier, and after two hours fight beate them from their Works, and when bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets flew about our ears as thick as haile; Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax,</hi> ſir <hi>William Fairfax,</hi> ſir <hi>Henry Fowles,</hi> with ſir <hi>Thomas Norcliffe</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the Dragooners, made way by dint of ſword and force of arms into the Town; neither muſt I forget the valiant carriage of Serjeant Major <hi>Forbes,</hi> who was as forward on the other ſide of the Town, whereof now by Gods Almighty power we were poſſeſſed of, and found therein two Drakes, with good ſtore of Ammunition, beſides we tooke 600 pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners that were common Souldiers, whoſe oaths were taken never to fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine in this cauſe; and ſo were diſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; alſo there was taken priſoners which are now in cuſtody, Six Captains, viz.

Thus have you a true Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that battell, wherein the hand of God was wonderfully ſeen to be with us; for they were more within the Towne which was well Fortified, then we with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, for they had two ſtrong Regiments under the command of Sir <hi>William Savill,</hi> and Colonell <hi>VVitherington,</hi> foure Troops of Horſe, and three of Dragoners, with good ſtore of Ammunition, which we ſhall make to appeare to them that ſhall come to fetch it from us.
